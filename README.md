# The Midnight Oil
Ok, so this is gonna be kinda like my notes during the 48-hour 
game jam development process. So first let's look at the themes.
## Themes
For this game jam, we got two themes and you can do either or both.
Those themes are <b>TOIL</b> as in working extremely hard or incessantly,
and <b>TOAD</b> as in the thing that isn't a frog. I'm not sure exactly
what I want the game to be like, but I like the theme TOIL. Before the jam
even started I was thinking about ideas for a game that could work, cause
I'm not a fan of horror, but I was trying to think about what was scary to
me. The thing that stuck out to me the most was being on my computer late at
night and occasionally getting a bad feeling and looking over my shoulder
to the door behind me. It's kinda the same vibe as being afraid of walking
up a set of stairs in the dark, like someone might be behind you.

So I think what could be good is leaning into the toil theme. Maybe you're a
college student or something and you're working on an essay. Or let's say a 
program haha. I think people might find that a bit more relatable. Burning
the midnight oil, so to speak, working on an assignment and I want to capture
the feeling of maybe there being something behind you, or maybe you're just
seeing things. I think that would be good.
## Mechanics
I remember when I was younger I watched a lot of youtube channels where
people would talk a lot about games that they liked and how their mechanics
were made in such a way to evoke a specific feeling. Like Resident Evil's 
tank controls were the main example I can remember. It solves the problem of
how to keep player controls consistent from weird scary changing camera
angles and it also makes the player feel a bit less powerful in certain
situations since you can't immediately just turn around at the drop of a hat
and it's a little unwieldy. I think that's cool. I think I want to do
something kind of similar, so I was thinking about controls, right? I said
earlier that I'm not a fan of horror stuff at all. Like I watched <i>Get 
Out</i> once and I was looking over my shoulder every few seconds for weeks,
and recently I had to watch the original <i>Pet Sematary</i> and I'm still
sleeping with the light on haha. But one game that I really liked that is
at least horror adjacent is <i>Inscryption</i>! Great game. I liked the
scenes where Leshy would ask you to go get something from around the room.
The first time was so scary because I didn't want to turn my back on him, so
every step I was turning back around to look at him as quick as I could haha.
I think I want it to control like that. I think what I'll do is I'll put the
player on a grid, like <i>Inscryption</i> that way each step feels deliberate
and you can consciously choose to look over your shoulder. I think that would
be scary, or hopefully at least fun.
